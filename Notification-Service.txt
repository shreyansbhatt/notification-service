Notification Service
 
 
	You are required to design and implement a RESTful API for a notification service. The service should support sending notifications via multiple channels
	(e.g., email, SMS, push notifications). The API should handle the following functionalities:
 
	Notification Types:
	Create, update, and delete notification types (e.g., promotional, transactional, alert).
	Retrieve details of a specific notification type by its ID.
	List all notification types.
 
	Send Notifications:
	Send a notification to a user via the specified channel.
	Retrieve the status of a sent notification.
	List all notifications sent within a specific time range, optionally filtered by user or notification type.
 
	### Requirements
 
	Entities:
	NotificationType: `Id`, `Name`, Description
	Notification: `Id`, `UserId`, `NotificationTypeId`, `Channel`, `Content`, `SentDate`, Status
	Channel: Enum (Email, SMS, PushNotification)
	**Technical Stack**:
	.NET Core / .NET 6+
	Entity Framework Core for data access
	In-memory database for simplicity
	ASP.NET Core Web API
